This dissertation is a study of the syntax of switch-reference
(SR) and its implications for the theory of grammar. SR, found in many
genetically and geographically diverse languages, is a phenomenon whereby
referential identity between subjects of hierarchically adjacent clauses
is encoded by the presence of a morpheme, usually suffixed to the verb of
the subordinate clause. Noncoreferentiality between subjects is indicated
by a different morpheme, likewise suffixed to the subordinate verbs.
The dissertation argues that SR should be analysed as a syntactic
rather than a purely pragmatic or functional feature of language; SR may
appear to be a device to eliminate possible ambiguity in discourse, but
SR-marking redundantly occurs even in environments that have no potential
for ambiguity. Moreover, SR-marking does not occur in certain
constructions where it would be expected, were it governed exclusively by
functional or pragmatic considerations. I propose instead that the syntax
of SR follows from the various locality conditions on syntactic binding
that are central to the Government and Binding theory of syntax. These
conditions carry the major explanatory burden in the theoretical
description of the SR systems from Native American, Australian, and New
Guinea languages which are surveyed in this dissertation. I attempt to
show that the apparent complexity and exotic nature of SR and associated
topics admit of a principled, intuitive account within the Government and
Binding framework.
