Phonologically prominent or "strong" positions are known for their ability to
resist positional neutralization processes such as vowel reduction or place
assimilation.  However, there are also cases of neutralization that affect
only strong positions, as when stressed syllables must be heavy, default
stress is inserted into roots, or word-initial onsets must be low in
sonority.  This dissertation shows that phonological processes specific to
strong positions are distinct from those involved in classic positional
neutralization effects because they always serve to augment the strong
position with a perceptually salient characteristic.  Formally, positional
augmentation effects are modeled by means of markedness constraints
relativized to strong positions.  Because positional augmentation constraints
are subject to certain substantive restrictions, as seen in their connection
to perceptual salience, they also have implications for the relationship
between functional grounding and phonological theory.
