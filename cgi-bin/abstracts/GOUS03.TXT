Deriving Economy: Syncope in Optimality Theory

(August 2003)

Maria Gouskova

Directed by Professor John J. McCarthy


The dissertation argues that markedness is lenient and relative: a form 
is marked only if there is another form that is unmarked. No 
constraints ban structure for the sake of banning structure; there are 
formal limits on the content of CON. The central consequence of this 
view is that economy constraints are excluded on principle; economy 
effects must instead follow from the interaction of independently 
motivated constraints.

While a range of economy effects is discussed, the empirical focus is 
on syncope. Case studies investigate syncope in Hopi, Tonkawa, 
Lillooet, Lushootseed, and Lebanese and Mekkan Arabic. Deleting vowels 
satisfies a range of markedness constraints; moreover, the same 
constraints that can be satisfied by syncope can also be satisfied by 
other processes that may not involve removal of structure. The 
standard "delete-where-you-can" view of syncope is argued to be 
inadequate; furthermore, economy constraints can actually be harmful if 
admitted into the grammar.
