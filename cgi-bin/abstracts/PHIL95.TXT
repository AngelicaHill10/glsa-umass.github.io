This dissertation is an investigation of how preschool children understand
the meaning of determiner universal quantifiers such as English 'every'
and 'all'. Although grasping the distributive force of such words, and
generally showing adult-like comprehension of simple universally
quantified sentences, the typical four year old is seen often to have a
strikingly nonadult-like understanding of the meaning of such sentences.
This is shown by the child's comprehension performance under certain
experimental conditions. The principal claim of this dissertation is that
the child comprehension phenomena in question is essentially linguistic in
etiology and derives for a preference for quantification over individual
events/situations rather than individual objects.
