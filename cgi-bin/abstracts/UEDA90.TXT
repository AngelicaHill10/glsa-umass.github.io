The goal of this dissertation is to examine Japanese phrase structure and
related parametric differences in syntax between English and Japanese.
In chapter 1, I present some basic concepts and principles of the
principles and parameters framework, within which the present study is
conducted.
In chapter 2, I argue that Japanese clauses, i.e., Ss and S's, are IPs and
CPs, respectively, and that the subject of Japanese clauses, as well as
that of English clauses, is in the specifier position of IP at
S-structure, and is assigned nominative case by Infl. Then, I show that
some of the syntactic differences between English and Japanese, which have
been observed in the literature, follow from the differences in the value
of the directionality parameter of head-government and its interactions
with other principles of UG.
Chapter 3 is devoted to the examination of the internal structure of "noun
phrases" in Japanese. I argue specifically that noun phrases in Japanese
are DPs, i.e. the maximal projections of the functional category D.
In chapter 4 I propose an analysis of the so-called "major subject" in
Japanese. I argue that the major subject originates in the specifier
position of the "subject DP" and is moved to the specifier position of the
higher empty Infl at S-structure. It is shown that, under this analysis,
the properties of the major subject largely follow from the interaction of
the principles of UG and the language-particular properties of Japanese
grammar.
