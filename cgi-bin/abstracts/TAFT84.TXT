Among the concerns of current psycholinguistic research has been anattempt to specify the constraints available and used in the processing oflinguistic material. Much of this work has focussed on the syntacticconstraints which the processor uses in imposing structure on the incominglexical material. In this thesis I argue that the case for phonologicalprocessing is not so different from the case for syntactic processing. Imake the working assumption that grammatical information of various typesis available to listeners to impose an interpretation on the incomingsignal, not just at the level of syntactic parsing, but prior to thatstage as well.

I hypothesize that the listener is using knowledge of language-specificprosodic constraints to impose structure on the incoming material and toidentify likely places for word onsets, independent of lexical accessitself. Two hypotheses are advanced concerning how constraints are used bythe listener. First, I hypothesize a "Salience-to Onset Strategy" whichhelps the listener locate word onsets on the basis of salient portions ofthe signal. Second, I hypothesize a "Prosodic Domain Strategy" with whichthe listener parses the incoming material into prosodic units forcomparison with stored lexical representations.

Supporting evidence is presented in a series of four psycholinguisticexperiments testing the predictions of the SOS and PDS. Experiments 1-3test the claims of the SOS and PDS for English. Experiment 4 is a pilotstudy testing the claims of the SOS and PDS for Japanese. I conclude by considering the implications of this work forpsycholinguistic models of lexical access, and for explanations of certainphonological phenomena found in natural languages.
