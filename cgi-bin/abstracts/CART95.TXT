This dissertation examines auditory language processing with two emphases:
the steps in the processing of an auditory input which identify those
characteristics which enable the listener to match the incoming signal to
a lexical item, and the morphological and phonological form of lexical
entries. Evidence is presented to support the Morphological Parsing
Hypothesis, a proposal that inflectional morphemes are recognized
prelexically. Moreover, it is shown that the analysis into stem and
inflectional affix is evaluated for phonological well-formedness prior to
a lexical search for the hypothesized stem (the Prelexical Phonological
Checking Hypothesis). Results from an experiment using German surface
homophones (with final obstruent devoicing) strengthen the claim of Lahiri
& Marslen-Wilson (1991) that lexical entries are stored in the form of
underlying phonological representations. Suggestive evidence that lexical
entries may be composed of radically underspecified featural
representations leads to the proposal of the Specified Feature Priority
Hypothesis, a means by which listeners may attend to those portions of the
acoustic/phonetic input which provide cues to the underlyingly specified
phonological features of the language.
