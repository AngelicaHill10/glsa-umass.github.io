Wh-Constructions in Japanese (2001)
Shimoyama, Junko 

Abstract:

This dissertation examines the syntax and semantics of three wh-constructions in Japanese: the interrogative and universal constructions and the internally headed relative clause construction.  A uniform analysis of the interrogative and universal constructions is proposed that does not involve English-type wh-movement.  An asymmetry in island sensitivity is shown to follow from the proposed interpretative process.  Further, it is shown that the kind of argument sharing observed in the internally headed relative clause construction is better analyzed in terms of anaphora than in terms of movement.
