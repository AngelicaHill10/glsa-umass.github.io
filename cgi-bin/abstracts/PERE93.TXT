This dissertation studies the acquisition of Wh-movement and the
development of the empty category system in children's grammar. It
contains empirical studies on issues on the acquisition of Wh-movement in
English and Spanish. The following topics are the object of investigation:
long distance movement and the role of barriers, structure of relative
clauses in child grammar, and the interpretation and production of
resumptive elements by children.
Child Grammar is hypothesized to contain a default chain composed of a
null operator linking a null constant. Null argument and relative clause
and question formation in early grammars are argued to be derived from
this default chain. The evidence considered in this dissertation supports
the view that null constants and not null pronouns are the primitive empty
category in child grammar. In the initial stage, before clausal nodes are
projected and subordination is acquired, the chain is derived by short
movement with adjunction to the maximal projection. Once a full syntactic
tree develops, the null operator-null constant chain is eventually
replaced by a set of fully developed A'-dependencies. The acquisition
process is hypothesized to be dependent on changes of the phrase structure
representation and the acquisition of syntactic features of the nominal
system: +/-anaphoric, +/-pronominal and +/-variable.
