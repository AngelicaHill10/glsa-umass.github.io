Contrast Preservation in Phonological Mappings
Lubowicz, Ania (2003) 

ABSTRACT:
The present study investigates how information about contrasts is employed 
in the grammar. It is proposed that contrast preservation exists as an 
independent principle, which, within the framework of Optimality Theory 
(Prince and Smolensky 1993), is formalized as a family of rankable and 
violable constraints on preserving contrasts. Those constraints interact 
with one another and with conflicting markedness constraints resulting in 
preservation or neutralization of underlying distinctions in surface forms 
(cf. Trubetzkoy 1971, Martinet 1967). By re-examining the role of contrast, 
this study makes a significant contribution to our understanding of a 
phonological system and the nature of a phonological mapping (cf. Kaye 
1974, 1975; Kisseberth 1976).
