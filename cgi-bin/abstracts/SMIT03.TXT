Adult speech perception is characterized by perceptual integration which gives 
rise to trading relations: less evidence from one acoustic property can be 
offset by more evidence from another. This dissertation reports perceptual 
experiments with young children native in different dialects of English. 
Identification results indicate that in perceiving final stop voicing, young 
children differ from adults in predominantly using either vowel duration or 
first formant offset frequency, rather than both. Which property children use 
appears to be a function of dialect background. Discrimination results suggest 
that integration may develop, at least for some contrasts, on the basis of 
learning patterns of covariation in the native language, with implications for 
theories of speech perception.
